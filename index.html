     <h1>&nbsp;&nbsp;About Me</h1>
     <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;I am Tanvi Agrawal and I am currently 13 years old. In my family I have a caring brother, Naman, a sweet mother and father. This year I am going to the 8th grade. I'm very passionate about &nbsp;&nbsp;playing competitive tennis and swimming. My favorite thing to do is to do arts and crafts in my free time. My favorite food is pasta.  </p>

    <h1>&nbsp;&nbsp;School</h1>
    <p>&nbsp;&nbsp; In 8th grade the most two subjects I am worried about is GTILA and Geometry. I am in the tennis team and in green team. I have many great friends in my school. I am an A student in all my &nbsp;&nbsp;classes. I skipped 7th grade math and Algebra 1. My favorite subject is Science because there is so much to explore and there is always something new to learn.</p>

      <h1>&nbsp;&nbsp;Vacations</h1>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;So far, in the United States I have visited 26 states and the capital. Outside of the USA, I have visited only India. By a long shot, my favorite vacation was probably going to Washington D.C. &nbsp;&nbsp;because I could take a lot of pictures and there was a lot of sight-seeing. 2nd place goes to Yellowstone National Park. When I went there, I was amazed by all the natural beauty there was.  </p>
